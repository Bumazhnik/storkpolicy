These cookies may include means for tracking your Shopping profile with our business partners and may include tracking technology from third-party affiliate-network operators. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, and track and target your product interests in order to provide a customized experience. A “cookie” is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Services. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with the Services with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your other interactions with the Services.</p>
<p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. “Session” cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views.
